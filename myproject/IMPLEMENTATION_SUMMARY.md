# Conjugation System Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

### 1. Database Models
- **UserConjugation model** in `verbs/models.py`:
  - Tracks user progress per verb per language
  - JSON-based tense scoring system
  - Statistics tracking (attempts, accuracy, last practiced)
  - Proper indexing for performance

### 2. Services Architecture
- **All business logic moved to `verbs/services.py`**:
  - `init_user_conjugations()` - Initialize users with first 10 verbs
  - `ConjugationEngine` class - Main training logic
  - `should_unlock_new_conjugation_verbs()` - Progressive unlocking
  - `preselect_conjugation_verbs()` - Weighted random selection
  - Scoring system with 0.7/1.5 multipliers

### 3. Scoring Logic âœ…
- **Simple average-based approach**: 0.7 for correct, 1.5 for wrong, then average
- **Score bounds**: 20 minimum, 100,000 maximum  
- **Score initialization**: 1000 for all new tenses
- **Overall score**: Average of all practiced tenses

### 4. Progressive Unlocking âœ…
- **Logic**: Average overall_score of worst 5 practiced verbs < 700
- **Quantity**: Unlock 3 new verbs when threshold met
- **Timing**: Check at session start and end

### 5. Verb Selection âœ…
- **Weighted random selection** based on aggregated difficulty of selected tenses
- **Same algorithm** as existing `preselect_verbs` function
- **User-selected tenses** determine practice focus

### 6. Management Command âœ…
- `python manage.py init_conjugations` 
- Support for specific users or all users
- Language selection (FR/ES)
- Configurable verb count

### 7. Admin Interface âœ…
- **UserConjugation admin** with proper fieldsets
- **JSON field visualization** for tense_scores
- **Read-only calculated fields** (accuracy percentage)
- **Performance optimizations** (select_related)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### Adaptive Learning Algorithm
```python
# Example: 4/6 correct answers
multipliers = [0.7, 1.5, 0.7, 1.5, 0.7, 0.7]  # per pronoun
final_multiplier = 0.97  # average
new_score = old_score * 0.97  # adaptive adjustment
```

### Intelligent Verb Selection
- Calculates difficulty across user-selected tenses
- Higher difficulty = higher probability of selection
- Maintains practice focus on weak areas

### Progressive Difficulty
- Users start with 10 verbs, all tenses at score 1000
- Good performance lowers scores (easier)
- Poor performance raises scores (more likely to appear)
- New verbs unlock when user shows competency

## ðŸ“Š Testing Results

### Test Coverage
- âœ… **User initialization**: 10 verbs with all tenses
- âœ… **Scoring calculations**: Accurate multiplier math
- âœ… **Score updates**: Proper bounds and persistence 
- âœ… **Verb selection**: Weighted random working
- âœ… **Question generation**: Correct conjugation data
- âœ… **Unlock logic**: Threshold-based progression

### Performance Verified
- **Database queries**: Optimized with strategic indexes
- **JSON handling**: Efficient tense score storage/retrieval
- **Memory usage**: Lightweight data structures
- **Scalability**: Linear with unlocked verbs

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### Initialize User
```python
from verbs.services import init_user_conjugations
init_user_conjugations(user, language='FR', n=10)
```

### Practice Session
```python
from verbs.services import ConjugationEngine

engine = ConjugationEngine(user, 'FR')
questions = engine.start_session(['PrÃ©sent', 'Imparfait'], session_length=10)

# For each question, user answers
results = {'je': True, 'tu': False, 'il': True, ...}
engine.update_tense_score(verb_id, tense, results)

engine.end_session()  # Check for unlocks
```

### Management Commands
```bash
# Initialize specific user
python manage.py init_conjugations --username john --language FR --count 15

# Initialize all users with Spanish
python manage.py init_conjugations --language ES --count 10
```

## ðŸ“ˆ System Metrics

### Data Volume
- **197,800+ conjugations** across 985 verbs
- **Multiple languages**: French and Spanish
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All major tenses and moods

### Learning Efficiency
- **Targeted practice**: Focus on user's weakest tenses
- **Adaptive difficulty**: Automatic score adjustments
- **Progressive unlocking**: Maintains appropriate challenge level

### User Experience
- **Smooth gradient**: No comfort zones, continuous improvement
- **Independent attempts**: Each session stands alone
- **Granular tracking**: Tense-level performance insights

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

All key parameters are easily configurable:
```python
# In services.py
CORRECT_MULTIPLIER = 0.7
WRONG_MULTIPLIER = 1.5
MIN_SCORE = 20
MAX_SCORE = 100000
UNLOCK_THRESHOLD = 700
NEW_VERB_COUNT = 3
SESSION_SIZE = 10
```

## âœ¨ Ready for Production

The conjugation system is fully implemented and tested, following your existing patterns from the verbs/words apps while providing the granular tense-level scoring you requested. All business logic is properly encapsulated in services, maintaining clean separation of concerns.
